# What does this have?
This OpenGL Template has Glad, Glfw, FreeGlut, and OpenGL, please read instructions below.

## Instructions
This can be very complicated so make sure to follow everything carefully.

1. Download VS Code. It can be found here: [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2. Create a new folder on your computer, place this somewhere it will be safe. This will be your main projects folder. Inside this main folder create another folder and name it whatever you want, such as "OpenGL Project 1". This main projects folder should hold all of your projects. Open up the folder you made inside the main projects folder in VS Code; this will be your project.

Seen here is the project structure. You should not open up the Projects folder in VS Code, but one of the actual project folders such as "OpenGL_Math".
